Hi! 
I am a Machine Learning Software Engineer at [Health[at]Scale](https://healthatscale.com/){:target="_blank"}.  

My general research interests are in the domain of machine learning. 
Over the years, I have explored various areas including interpretable ML, adversarial ML, natural language processing and computer vision, with a track record of publishing in top-tier venues such as AAAI and EMNLP. 
My complete research works can be found [here](/research).

In 2020, I completed my M.S. in Computer Sciences at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu){:target="_blank"}. At UW-Madison, I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant under Prof. [Aws Albarghouthi](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~aws/){:target="_blank"}. 
Prior to that in 2018, I graduated with a B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering (with a minor in Computer Science) from the [Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}, where I worked under Prof. [Amit Sethi](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/){:target="_blank"} for my Bachelors Project.  

In Summer 2019, I was a Researcher Intern at [Microsoft Research-Cambridge(UK)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/){:target="_blank"}, where I worked on improving data compliance in healthcare projects. Earlier during my undergraduate years, I interned as a data analyst at American Express in Gurugram (India).
