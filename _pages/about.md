Hi! I am an Applied Scientist - II at [Amazon AGI](https://amazon.jobs/content/en/teams/agi){:target="_blank"}.
My work revolves around building multimodal LLMs with conversational and agentic capabilities for edge devices.

Previously, I was a Machine Learning Engineer - II at [AWS Neuron](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/neuron/){:target="_blank"}. I worked on the enablement and performance optimization of LLMs on the [Trainium ML accelerator](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/trainium/){:target="_blank"} and its XLA-based software stack. My primary contributions were designing and developing fundamental building blocks for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, including specialized algorithms for efficient context encoding and token generation.

Earlier, I spent three great years building healthcare AI tech at [Health[at]Scale](https://healthatscale.com/){:target="_blank"}.  
As a Senior Machine Learning Software Engineer, I helped create a new product for providing actionable clinical insights to high-risk patients, launch  multiple new apps from the ground-up, and develop ML model prototypes for novel problems in the healthcare space.  

My general research interests are in the domain of machine learning. 
Over the years, I have explored various areas including interpretable ML, adversarial ML, natural language processing and computer vision, with a track record of publishing in prestigious venues such as AAAI, EMNLP and IEEE conferences. 
My complete research works can be found [here](/research).

In 2020, I completed my M.S. in Computer Sciences at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu){:target="_blank"}. At UW-Madison, I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant under Prof. [Aws Albarghouthi](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~aws/){:target="_blank"}. 
Prior to that in 2018, I graduated with a B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering (with a minor in Computer Science) from the [Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}, where I worked under Prof. [Amit Sethi](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/){:target="_blank"} for my Bachelors Project.  

In Summer 2019, I was a Researcher Intern at [Microsoft Research in Cambridge (UK)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/){:target="_blank"}, where I worked on improving data compliance in healthcare projects. Earlier as an undergraduate, I interned as a data analyst at American Express in Gurugram (India).
