### Abstract
Modern text classification models are susceptible to adversarial examples, perturbed versions of the original text indiscernible by humans but which get misclassified by the model. 
We present BAE, a powerful black box attack for generating grammatically correct and semantically coherent adversarial examples. 
BAE replaces and inserts tokens in the original text by masking a portion of the text and leveraging a language model to generate alternatives for the masked tokens. 
Compared to prior work, we show that BAE performs a stronger attack on three widely used models for seven text classification datasets.
